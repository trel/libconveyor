feat(libconveyor): Implement dual ringbuffer with robust I/O handling

This commit introduces a dual ringbuffer library (libconveyor) designed for in-memory read-ahead and write-behind buffering, with a focus on POSIX-like I/O operations.

Key features and fixes included:
- **Dual Ringbuffer Implementation:** Core logic for both read-ahead and write-behind buffering, including `RingBuffer` utility.
- **Asynchronous I/O Workers:** Dedicated worker threads for read and write operations, utilizing mutexes and condition variables for thread-safe access and communication.
- **Correct Flag Handling:** Implemented robust handling of `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR`, and `O_APPEND` flags, including a cross-platform solution for `O_ACCMODE`.
- **Enhanced `lseek` Behavior:** `conveyor_lseek` now correctly invalidates and clears relevant buffers, and resets EOF state, ensuring consistency after seeking.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Integrated `errno` and a `LIBCONVEYOR_ERROR` constant for consistent error reporting across all `conveyor_` functions.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** `conveyor_destroy` ensures all pending writes are flushed and worker threads are properly joined upon destruction.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Developed a deterministic test suite covering core functionalities, including buffered reads, writes, flushes, `lseek`, and append mode, to ensure correctness and stability.

Root Cause Analysis for Major Bug:
The primary bug was identified in `conveyor_create` where an incorrect bitwise operation `(flags & O_RDONLY)` was used to check for read access. Since `O_RDONLY` is defined as `0`, this condition was always false, leading to the read buffer never being enabled for read-only files. This was fixed by correctly using `(flags & O_ACCMODE)` to isolate and compare access modes, ensuring proper buffer initialization. A cross-platform definition for `O_ACCMODE` was added to support Windows builds.

This significantly improves the library's reliability and performance characteristics.
